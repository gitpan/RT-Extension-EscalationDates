=head1 NAME

C<RT::Extension::EscalationDates> - Set start and due time automatically when

=head1 DESCRIPTION

interface. It provides handling business hours defined in RT site configuration
file.


=head1 INSTALLATION

This extension based on the following modules:

    RT >= 4.0.0
    Date::Manip >= 6.25

To install this extension, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
    make initdb

Note: Please read the following section before initiating the database.


=head1 CONFIGURATION


=head2 RT SITE CONFIGURATION

To enable this extension edit the RT site configuration located in
C<$RT_HOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm> (where C<$RT_HOME> is the path to your RT
installation):

    Set(@Plugins,qw(RT::Extension::EscalationDates));

Note: If you use C<make initdb> during L<installation|/"INSTALLATION"> you'll
create a custom field with the name 'Priority' so it's unnecessary to
create one manually. This custom field provides the values 'A' till 'D'.

Add the custom field with your priorities to your configuration:

    Set($PriorityField, 'Priority');

Also you must define several priorities and relative dates for escalations:

    Set(%EscalateTicketsByPriority, ( 
        'A' => 'in 2 business hours',
        'B' => 'in 22 business hours',
        'C' => 'in 70 business hours',
        'D' => 'in 468 business hours'
    ));

Additionally you must define a default priority used when creating a ticket:

    Set($DefaultPriority, 'C');

Use only already configured priorities from C<%EscalateTicketsByPriority>, for
example C<C>.

To overwrite C<Date::Manip>'s default configuration you may set the following:

    Set(%DateManipConfig, (
        'WorkDayBeg', '9:00',
        'WorkDayEnd', '17:00', 
        #'WorkDay24Hr', '0',
        #'WorkWeekBeg', '1',
        #'WorkWeekEnd', '7'
    ));

You can find more information about the configurable parameters under
L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Date-Manip/lib/Date/Manip/Config.pod#BUSINESS_CONFIGURATION_VARIABLES>.

After all your new configuration will take effect after restarting your RT
environment:

    rm -rf $RT_HOME/var/mason_data/obj/* && service apache2 restart

This is an example for deleting the mason cache and restarting the Apache HTTP
web server on a Debian GNU/Linux based operating system.
