NAME
    "RT::Extension::EscalationDates" - Set start and due time automatically
    when creating a ticket

DESCRIPTION
    This RT Extension sets start and due time when creating a ticket via the
    web interface. It provides handling business hours defined in RT site
    configuration file.

INSTALLATION
    This extension based on the following modules:

        RT >= 4.0.0
        Date::Manip >= 6.25

    To install this extension, run the following commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
        make initdb

    Note: Please read the following section before initiating the database.

CONFIGURATION
  RT SITE CONFIGURATION
    To enable this extension edit the RT site configuration located in
    "$RT_HOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm" (where $RT_HOME is the path to your RT
    installation):

        Set(@Plugins,qw(RT::Extension::EscalationDates));

    Note: If you use "make initdb" during installation you'll create a
    custom field with the name 'Priority' so it's unnecessary to create one
    manually. This custom field provides the values 'A' till 'D'.

    Add the custom field with your priorities to your configuration:

        Set($PriorityField, 'Priority');

    Also you must define several priorities and relative dates for
    escalations:

        Set(%EscalateTicketsByPriority, ( 
            'A' => 'in 2 business hours',
            'B' => 'in 22 business hours',
            'C' => 'in 70 business hours',
            'D' => 'in 468 business hours'
        ));

    Additionally you must define a default priority used when creating a
    ticket:

        Set($DefaultPriority, 'C');

    Use only already configured priorities from %EscalateTicketsByPriority,
    for example "C".

    To overwrite "Date::Manip"'s default configuration you may set the
    following:

        Set(%DateManipConfig, (
            'WorkDayBeg', '9:00',
            'WorkDayEnd', '17:00', 
            #'WorkDay24Hr', '0',
            #'WorkWeekBeg', '1',
            #'WorkWeekEnd', '7'
        ));

    You can find more information about the configurable parameters under
    <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Date-Manip/lib/Date/Manip/Config.pod#BUSINE
    SS_CONFIGURATION_VARIABLES>.

    After all your new configuration will take effect after restarting your
    RT environment:

        rm -rf $RT_HOME/var/mason_data/obj/* && service apache2 restart

    This is an example for deleting the mason cache and restarting the
    Apache HTTP web server on a Debian GNU/Linux based operating system.
